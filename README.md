# Diabetes-Prediction
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics using machine learning techniques.

# Overview
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and intervention are crucial for managing diabetes effectively and reducing its complications. Machine learning models can help predict diabetes risk based on health metrics, allowing for timely intervention and personalized care.

# Requirements
Libraries:
pandas,
matplotlib,
numpy,
scikit-learn,
xgboost (for advanced modeling),

# Dataset
Refer git repository "Diabetes prediction" for the csv file

# Univariate Analysis
Performed various univariate analysis on the dataset including info(),head(),isnull(),nunique(),shape and more
Performed various plotting functions for visualizations

# Bivariate Analysis
Performed bivariate correlation for the dataset
Perform pearson correlation function

# Result
Visualized the results through histograms,piecharts and scatterplots.
